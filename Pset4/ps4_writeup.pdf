simulation without antibiotic 
Timestep = 299, (767.94, 4.18)
At timestep 299 for the simulatin without antibiotic, there is a 95% confidence that the numer of bacteria will fall within the range of 763.76 and 772.12.

1. For simulation A, the total number of bacteria increases with a decreasing rate all the way from 100 to around 880 bacteria from timestep = 0 to timestep = 50,
   where it plateaus until antibiotic was introduced. 
   For simulation B, the total bacteria increases with a decreasing rate from 100 to 176 bacteria from timestep = 0 to timestep = 30. The total bacteria count decreases 
   linearly from 176 to around 90 from timestep = 30 to timestep = 150

2. For simulation A, the number of resistant bacteria increases sharply from 0 to 220 between timestep = 0 to timestep = 30 and decreases from 220 count to 35 count between 
   timestep = 35 to timestep = 95 where it plateaus until bacteria was introuduced.
   For simulation B, the number of resistant bacteria increases from 0 to 85 between timestep = 0 and timestep = 50, where it decreases linearly from 85 to 60 between timestep 
   = 50 to timestep = 150

3. For both simulations, the total bacteria count drop sharply in a single timestep and getting equal to the number of resistant bacteria.

4. For simulation A, the resistant bacteria increases slowly from 35 count to 200 count where it plateaus.
   For simulation B, the resistant bacteria drops sharply from 60 count all the way to 0 count in 75 timesteps.
